# Predicting Age of Abalones

Abalones are onetype of reef-dwelling marine snails. It is difficult to tell the ages of abalones because their shellsizes not only depend on how old they are, but also depend on the availability of food. The study of age is usually by obtaining a stained sample of the shell and looking at the number of rings through a microscope. <br />

We are interested in using some of abalones physical measurements, especially the height measurement to predict their ages. Biologists believe that a simple linear regression model with normal error assumption is appropriate to describe the relationship between the height of abalones and their ages. In particular, that a larger height is associated with an older age.
